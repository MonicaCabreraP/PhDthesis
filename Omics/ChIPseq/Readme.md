TP53 is a DNA binding TF
The binding preferences of TP53 are known.
TP53 binds to DNA as a homo-tetramer recognizing two decamers of RRRCWWGYYY (el-Deiry et al. 1992), each decamer is called a “half site” with underlined 4 nucleotides (nt) CWWG as the core, usually one full site consists of two half sites. 
 Genomic binding is not always followed by transcription changes; p53 exhibits both “default” and “distinct” binding.
 Since p53 has induced and constitutive functions, and binding may serve to induce transcription, but also to maintain basal transcription levels (Zheltukhin and Chumakov, 2010), p53 occupancy at some of these sites may support the basal expression of the nearby genes.
 Since p53 binds to enhancers (Melo et al., 2013), occupancy at some of these sites may exert long distance effect on gene expression.
Some of the most commonly used approaches are chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) to localize regions bound by a certain TF or a modified histone, 

Binding within or nearby target genes involved in cell
proliferation and survival enables the p53 tumor
suppressor gene to regulate their transcription and
cell-cycle progression
Chromatin-binding profiles reveal specific interactions of p53
with promoter regions of nearby target genes, but also with dis-
tant locations that harbor characteristics of enhancer domains
Interestingly, the ChIP-seq signals are quantitatively comparable between different experiments. Furthermore, decreasing ChIP-seq signals are strongly correlated with decreasing probability of TP53 binding both by the random forest and the deep learning models 
The collected public ChIP-seq data against TP53 are summarized in Supplemental Table S7.
