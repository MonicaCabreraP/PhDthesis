Hi-C User Pipeline (HiCUP) is a bioinformatics pipeline for processing Hi-C data that takes paired-end FASTQ files along with a FASTA reference genome and associated aligner indices and then reports valid di-tags* in BAM/SAM format.The final valid dataset is in **BAM format**, with read pairs constituting a di-tag* placed on adjacent lines within the file.




*di-tag: The resulting molecule after the experimental part comprising two different DNA fragments separated by a modified restriction site. Since these two fragments are positioned close to each other during fixation, by analyzing the composition of a population of di-tags generated by a Hi-C experiment it is possible to infer genomic three-dimensional organization. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4706059/
