In my doctoral thesis I investigated p53's ability to reconfigure the genome and govern transcriptional regulation by inducing alterations in the temporal and spatial genome structure. 

The **hypothesis of my dissertation** is that p53 exerts its influence by modulating physical connections between regulatory elements, such as enhancers and gene promoters, via the manipulation of DNA loops.
To assess this hypothesis, a comprehensive investigation into the potential effects of p53 activation in HCT116 cell lines achieved through pharmacologically inhibiting MDM2 with Nutlin-3a drug has been performed. This approach synergistically integrates diverse genomic datasets, encompassing Hi-C, Promoter Capture Hi-C, RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq methodologies. 

In this repository you will be able to find all scripts to reproduce my PhD thesis.
