In this repository, you'll be able to find all the scripts necessary to replicate the various analyses and figures showcased in my doctoral thesis. The repository is structured as follows:

- **[Processing](processing/) Folder**: This section houses scripts meticulously organized by technique, serving as tools to process the raw data effectively.

- **[Figures](figures/) Folder**: Within this folder, you'll find scripts tailored to regenerate the statistics and figures featured in the thesis.

- **[Data](data/) Folder**: If you wish to bypass the data processing step, you can access the Data Folder. It contains supplementary data tables and essential processed data, eliminating the need for additional processing, and enabling the straightforward generation of most figures presented in the manuscript.
