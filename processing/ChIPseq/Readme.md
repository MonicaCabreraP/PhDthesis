# ChIP-seq

ChIP-seq is a method used to analyze protein interactions with DNA. ChIP-seq combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins.

In this thesis, to process the CHiP-seq data I used the criteria established by the [ENCODE Consortium](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lG_Rd7fnYgRpSIqrIfuVlAz2dW1VaSQThzk836Db99c/edit#) in their Data Standards. In the methods section of my thesis you can find the commands to run the software, but a general workflow to process Hi-C follows these steps:

1. Raw read Quality Control
2. Trimming adapters
3.
