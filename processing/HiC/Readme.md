# HiC (High-throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture)

Provides valuable insights into how chromosomes are spatially arranged and interact with each other. 

In this thesis we used the **TADbit** pipeline [TADbit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5540598/pdf/pcbi.1005665.pdf) (Serra et al. 2017) with a specific version available at https://github.com/fransua/TADbit/tree/p53_javierre to process the Hi-C data.

The steps followed can be found in the [TADbit tutorial website](https://3dgenomes.github.io/TADbit/tutorial.html#from-fastq-files-to-interaction-matrices).
