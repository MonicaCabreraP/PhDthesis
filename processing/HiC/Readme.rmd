# HiC (High-throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture)

Provides valuable insights into how chromosomes are spatially arranged and interact with each other. In this thesis we used the **TADbit** pipeline [TADbit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5540598/pdf/pcbi.1005665.pdf) (Serra et al. 2017) with a specific version available at https://github.com/fransua/TADbit/tree/p53_javierre.

* [Chicago R Package](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5540598/pdf/pcbi.1005665.pdf)  

## Dependencies

* [HiCUP](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/hicup/) (0.8.2)
* [Chicago R Package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Chicago.html)  

## Workflow

## 1. FASTQ quality control
It assess the quality of Hi-C sequencing data examining various aspects to identify potential issues or biases that might affect downstream analysis and interpretation.
